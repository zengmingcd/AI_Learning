## Course Note


### 3 principles make Azure AI services dramatically improve speed-to-market
- Prebuilt and ready to use
- Accessed through APIs
- Available on Azure

### 2 types of AI service resources
- Multi-service resource: a resource created in the Azure portal that provides access to multiple Azure AI services with a single key and endpoint. Use the resource Azure AI services when you need several AI services or are exploring AI capabilities. When you use an Azure AI services resource, all your AI services are billed together.
- Single-service resources: a resource created in the Azure portal that provides access to a single Azure AI service, such as Speech, Vision, Language, etc. Each Azure AI service has a unique key and endpoint. These resources might be used when you only require one AI service or want to see cost information separately.

### Use Azure AI service
- Create AI service resource
- Associate with Azure AI studio
- Use key and endpoint to authorize to request API


### Terms in Azure AI
- API – application programming interfaces (APIs) enable software components to communicate, so one side can be updated without stopping the other from working.
- Artificial Intelligence (AI) – computer programs that respond in ways that are normally associated with human reasoning, learning, and thought.
- Azure AI services – a portfolio of AI services that can be incorporated into applications quickly and easily without specialist knowledge. Azure AI services is also the name for the multi-service resource created in the Azure portal that provides access to several different Azure AI services with a single key and endpoint.
- Endpoint – the location of a resource, such as an Azure AI service.
- Key – a private string that is used to authenticate a request.
- Machine learning – the ability for computer programs to learn from large amounts of data, in a process known as "training".
- Multi-service resource – the AI service resource created in the Azure portal that provides access to a bundle of AI services.
- Single-service resource – a resource created in the Azure portal that provides access to a single Azure AI service, such as Speech, Vision, Language, etc. Each Azure AI service has a unique key and endpoint.
- RESTful API – a scalable web application programming interface used to access Azure AI services.
