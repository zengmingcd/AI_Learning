## Course Note
### What is AI
- AI is software that imitates human behaviors and capabilities. Key workloads include:

  - Machine learning - This is often the foundation for an AI system, and is the way we "teach" a computer model to make predictions and draw conclusions from data.
  - Computer vision - Capabilities within AI to interpret the world visually through cameras, video, and images.
  - Natural language processing - Capabilities within AI for a computer to interpret written or spoken language, and respond in kind.
  - Document intelligence - Capabilities within AI that deal with managing, processing, and using high volumes of data found in forms and documents.
  - Knowledge mining - Capabilities within AI to extract information from large volumes of often unstructured data to create a searchable knowledge store.
  - Generative AI - Capabilities within AI that create original content in a variety of formats including natural language, image, code, and more.

### Machine Learning
- Machine Learning is the foundation for most AI solutions.
- Machine Learning based on the Data. Machine Learning model try to find the relationship between data.
- Machine Learning in Microsoft Azure
  - Automated machine learning: this feature enables non-experts to quickly create an effective machine learning model from data.
  - Azure Machine Learning designer: a graphical interface enabling no-code development of machine learning solutions.
  - Data metric visualization: analyze and optimize your experiments with visualization.
  - Notebooks: write and run your own code in managed Jupyter Notebook servers that are directly integrated in the studio.


### Computer Vision
- Computer Vision is an area of AI that deals with visual processing.
- Most computer vision solutions are based on machine learning models that can be applied to visual input from cameras, videos, or images.
- common computer vision tasks:
  - Image classification
  - Object detection
  - Semantic segmentation: an advanced machine learning technique in which individual pixels in the image are classified according to the object to which they belong. 
  - Image analysis
  - Face detection, analysis, and recognition
  - Optical character recognition (OCR)
- Computer Vision in Microsoft Azure
  - Image Analysis: capabilities for analyzing images and video, and extracting descriptions, tags, objects, and text.
  - Face: capabilities that enable you to build face detection and facial recognition solutions.
  - Optical Character Recognition (OCR): capabilities for extracting printed or handwritten text from images, enabling access to a digital version of the scanned text.

### Natural Language Processing
- NLP:the area of AI that deals with creating software that understands written and spoken language.
- NLP can:
  - Analyze and interpret text in documents, email messages, and other sources.
  - Interpret spoken language, and synthesize speech responses.
  - Automatically translate spoken or written phrases between languages.
  - Interpret commands and determine appropriate actions.
- NLP in Microsoft Azure
  - Azure AI Speech is another service that can be used to build natural language processing solutions

### Document Intelligence
- The area of AI that deals with managing, processing, and using high volumes of a variety of data found in forms and documents.
- Document Intelligence in Microsoft Azure
  - Azure AI Document Intelligence to build solutions that manage and accelerate data collection from scanned documents.

### Knowledge Mining
- The term used to describe solutions that involve extracting information from large volumes of often unstructured data to create a searchable knowledge store.
- Knowledge Mining in Microsoft Azure
  - Azure AI Search, a private, enterprise, search solution that has tools for building indexes

### Generative AI
- A category of capabilities within AI that create original content.
- Generative AI in Microsoft Azure
  - Azure OpenAI Service is Microsoft's cloud solution for deploying, customizing, and hosting generative AI models.
